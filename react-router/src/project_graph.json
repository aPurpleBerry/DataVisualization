      "Details": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator. It can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Its implementation was released as open-source software in 2009 and began to be used then.",

      "Details": "Ethereum is the first decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. It was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and launched in 2015. This network serves as the foundation for an ecosystem of interoperable, decentralized applications (dApps) powered by token economies and automated smart contracts. Assets and applications designed on Ethereum are built with self-executing smart contracts that eliminate the need for a central authority or intermediary.  The network is powered by its native cryptocurrency ether (ETH), which is used to pay transaction fees. Ethereum has the characteristics of being open-source, programmable, private, and censorship-resistant, forming the backbone of a decentralized internet.",
